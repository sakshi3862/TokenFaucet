# Token Faucet

## Project Description

The Token Faucet smart contract allows users to request small amounts of Ether for testing and development purposes. It ensures fair distribution by enforcing a cooldown period between requests per address.

## Project Vision

To empower developers and testers on blockchain networks by providing an automated and decentralized way to access test funds without relying on centralized faucet services.

## Key Features

- Request tokens once per cooldown period (e.g., every hour).
- Owner-configurable drip amount.
- Owner can withdraw remaining funds.
- Ether-based (no external token contracts needed).

## Future Scope

- Integration with ERC20 token distribution instead of native Ether.
- UI for easier access and drip request tracking.
- Extend support for multiple cooldown periods based on user roles.
